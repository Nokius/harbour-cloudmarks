# cloudMarks - for usage with ownCloud

A simple client for the owncloud bookmarks app running native on SailfishOS devices.
The application can be installed from Jolla Store, via Warehouse application, or straight from [openrepos](https://openrepos.net/content/hwesselmann/cloudmarks).

Please help to localize the application in more languages - files are on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/h-dawgde/cloudmarks/dashboard/).

_If you are using a self-signed certificate with your ownCloud server, you need to add it to your device in order to use this application properly_
